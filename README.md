# Yelp-API-Sentiment-Analysis

This project consisted of setting up and utilizing the Yelp API to perform sentiment analysis on reviews of a certain industry/topic of our choice. In my project, I decided to explore the sentiments regarding sushi in the New Brunswick area of New Jersey. Although unsuccessful due to a key error, this project emphasizes the potential uses of Yelp API and practices sentiment analysis, a very critical part of Data Science. 

Attached in this repository is the Jupyter Notebook containing all programming code for this project, as well as the .py textfile containing my personal API key and client ID.
